On the other hand, there are many constraints for the usage of available bandwidth such as: capacity of the communication channel, speed of UAVs, error-prone structure of the wireless links and lack of security with broadcast communication. A FANET protocol must satisfy the bandwidth capacity requirement so that it can relay very high resolution real time image or video under several constraints.]]></pText></PageText>
